# Brunch Bliss Café

Brunch Bliss Café (client) has approached us to enhance their restaurant application with a new feature. Specifically, they want a keyword search functionality that allows users to type into a textbox and get search results based on the keyword from their menu. Your colleague started working on this feature but has been pulled away for an urgent issue and has passed the task on to you.

Your challenge, should you choose to accept it, is to build the keyword search feature for our client, Brunch Bliss Café.

## Part 1 (Build Feature)

- Build a keyword search feature
- As the user types into the search bar, the results should appear (no need for a submit button)
- No need to worry about the CSS

## Part 2 (Optimize -- Debounce)

- Optimize the search functionality to improve the unnecessary API calls. We don't want to call the API on every letterpress
- Use Debouncing to allow for optimization

## Part 3 (Optimize -- Memoize)

Optimize the search functionality to improve performance and reduce unnecessary API calls by implementing memoization. What happens if we have already searched for that keyword?

## Part 4 (Handling Errors)

While implementing the keyword search functionality, you realize that various potential errors might occur, such as network issues, API failures, or unexpected bugs in the search component. To ensure the application remains stable and provides a good user experience, explain how we might want to handles these errors gracefully?
