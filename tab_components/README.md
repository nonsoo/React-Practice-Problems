# Tab components

Royal Thai Bistro wants to add a tab component to its application to display different content based on the selected tab. The tab component should have three tabs: "Short", "Middle", and "Final". Clicking on each tab will display a different component in the results section. Additionally, there should be an indicator to show which tab is currently active.

Your challenge, should you choose to accept is as follows:

- Create a `TabComponent` that manages the state of the selected tab.
- Add three tabs labelled "Short", "Middle", and "Final".
- Display different components based on the selected tab in the results section.
- Highlight the active tab to indicate which tab is currently selected.
