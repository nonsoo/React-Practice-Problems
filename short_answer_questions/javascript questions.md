## Functions

Explain the difference between function declarations and function expressions in JavaScript. Provide an example of each.

## Loops

**Write a for loop that prints numbers from 1 to 10.**

**How does a `for...of` loop differ from a `for...in` loop? Provide an example where each would be appropriate to use.**

## Arrays

```js
const lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10];
```

Given the array above, add an element to the end of the array

Several higher-order functions exist on the Array Prototype and two in particular are the `map` and the `forEach` function. Explain the differences between them and give an example of how they can be used.

We going to create a version of the `map` higher-order function from scratch. This function is going to take a lst of objects with the following shape `{name:"george",age:"23"}`. Using the brandly new created function, the function should return a list of names.

Elaborate more on NextJS

- Go back to the fundamentals of how React is just a library wheras next is the full-stack framework
- NextJS runs the node server

function declaration vs function expression

- Practice the difference between these two terms
- Review hoisting and how it impacts declerations vs expressions

Review array methods

- map and forEach (what's the point of forEach?)
- push
