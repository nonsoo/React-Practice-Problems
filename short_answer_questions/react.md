# React Short Answer Questions

## Question 1

You have a large single page application (SPA) which has several routes that contains a lot of JavaScript - as a result, the bundle size of the entire application is very large. Users have noted that the application is slow to initially load but once the first render happens, it seems to be working fine.

A number of users have reported this occurrence happening and you want to investigate. Knowing that we have a SPA, and multiple routes, what would you propose to optimize this application?

## Question 2

You need to create a modal that appears above all other content on the page, even if it's nested within other components. Explain how you would build this feature.

## Question 3

Explain how to create and use a Context in a React application. Include code for creating a context provider and consuming the context in a child component.

## Question 4

How can you optimize the performance of a component that consumes context values to prevent unnecessary re-renders?
