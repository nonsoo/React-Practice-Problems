# Colour Picker

TrueTone Labs have approached us to build a colour picker feature for their web app. They initially want us to build a simple color picker that allows a user to select a colour using the `HTML` color input and then display the chosen colour within a component.

## Part 1: Basic Color Picker

- Create a component called `ColorPicker` that allows the user to select a color using an HTML color input.
- The selected color should be displayed in another component called `ColorDisplay`.

## part 2

Colours on the web can be represented in many different ways, such as by name, HSL, or RGB values. In the previous task, we created a colour picker using the HTML input element. Now, let's enhance it by adding HSL sliders.

- Create a component with three sliders for HSL values: Hue, Saturation, and Lightness.
- Combine the values from these sliders to generate an HSL colour.
- Display the resulting colour in the `ColorDisplay` component.
